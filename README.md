# README.md Generator
  
  ## Description
  
  *  A quality README file is an invaluable addition to any project a developer works on. This is the first thing a person sees when they visit a repo on Github. You can think of it as the initial point of contact. This is important because it gives a person an idea of what they can expect to see in the code and essential information about the project overall. What is included in a README file is largely up to the developer. However, most include a title, description, and an explanation of the what, why, and how of the project. This project uses user input to generate a professional README.md file. It is a command-line application and uses the npm Inquirer package to receive input. 
  *  My motivation for completing this project was to get a better handle of Node.js and to increase my knowledge of server side development. Up until this point, my education has been on the front-end. Thus, this was a great dive into a new area of web development. 
  *  The level of quality of a README file can differentiate a high-quality repo from a low-quality one. While there is no one right way to structure the file, this is one very wrong way that includes not having one at all or one that is limited in the information it gives. This app serves as a guide to create a quality README.md file. The user inputs the information and then that data is used to generate a md file for them. It is important to note that this is a start point and does not need to be the only way a user structures their READMEs.
  *  I learned more about Node.js in developing this project and dove into more server side coding!
